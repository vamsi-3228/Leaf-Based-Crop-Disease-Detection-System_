# 🌿 Leaf-Based Crop Disease Detection System

## 📌 Problem Statement
Farmers often fail to identify crop diseases early, which results in crop loss and incorrect pesticide usage.
Most disease detection requires experts or laboratory testing which is slow and expensive.

This project builds an AI-based system that detects crop diseases using only leaf images.
The system identifies:
- Crop name
- Disease name
- Confidence percentage
- Treatment suggestion

No soil data, weather data, or sensor information is used.
Only leaf images are analyzed.# Leaf-Based-Crop-Disease-Detection-System_
